            Hey there! I'm Danielius or better know as VX_MEDIA, a passionate photographer and digital media creator with a love for the raw energy of drifting. Through my lens, I capture the intensity, motion, and emotion of every drift, turning fleeting moments into lasting memories.
            From the roar of engines to the perfect angle of a slide, my work blends technical precision with artistic storytelling. Whether it’s the adrenaline of the track or the beauty of automotive culture, my goal is to bring each moment to life in a way that resonates with fellow enthusiasts.
            Take a look around, and enjoy the ride!

            I started my photography journey in April 2024, drawn to the fast-paced world of motorsports and the thrill of capturing raw, unscripted moments. Since then, my lens has been focused on the art of drifting—freezing the perfect slide, the tire smoke, and the pure adrenaline that makes this sport so electrifying.
            Now, I’m proud to be part of Spinout Drift as a media creator, capturing the team’s journey both on and off the track. My goal is to showcase the passion, precision, and chaos of drifting in a way that immerses viewers into the heart of the action.
            From high-speed cornering to behind-the-scenes moments, I strive to turn each frame into a story. Now here is some of my past work!

            Here you will get all the updates about my drift career! On January 17th I bought a BMW E36 Compact. It had its fair share of problems but we had them all sorted and was ready to go! On march 29th I
            had participated in my first ever drift practice and in my eyes, it went pretty smooth considering it was my first time behind the wheel of a drift car! Here is the vlog!
